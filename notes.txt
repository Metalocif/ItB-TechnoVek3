Some nonobvious things:
- Tossing rocks deals damage based on whether they explode and their max HP.
It's 2 per max HP, +1 if it explodes. The Digger's hard rocks deal 4, explosive rocks deal 3.
This should cover modded rocks as well.
- Tossing rocks applies extra effects if they are burning/acidified (fire and ACID, predictably).
Rocks die if they are on fire, so be quick.
- The Digger's shrapnel can be targeted at a single rock or all rocks.
- You want as many rocks on the battlefield as possible; therefore, when you toss a pawn, spawn a rock as well.
- The Moth's reposition range increases with its movespeed.
- The Moth can push things twice in one attack with its reposition upgrade.

Thanks to Generic for sprites, Pilot_Arrogant for coding help, and both for feedback.
